MSc. Computing - Dissertation Repository: A Comparison Between Decision Tree Algorithm and a Hybrid Approach of Decision Tree Algorithm with Symbolic Logic

- This dissertation aimed to enhance decision tree algorithms by incorporating symbolic logic, addressing the limitation of overfitting.
- The findings demonstrated that integrating symbolic logic improved the predictive accuracy and generalization capabilities of decision tree models, as evidenced by improved evaluation scores.

The key research deliverables and conclusions are:
1. Integrating symbolic logic into decision tree algorithms improved their performance.
2. The decision tree model became more interpretable with the mix of symbolic rules.
3. The overfitting issue in decision tree models was mitigated, as shown by an improvement in the cross-validation score, indicating better generalization to new data.
4. The method relied on utilizing Prolog with PySwip and Scikit-learn, allowing for seamless integration of symbolic rules with relatively low computer resource requirements.
